/**
 * TransitionLike is a helper interface to represent a quasi-Transition, without specifying the full Transition  interface in this file.
 * For example, wherever d3-zoom allows a Transition to be passed in as an argument, it internally immediately invokes its `selection()`
 * method to retrieve the underlying Selection object before proceeding.
 * d3-brush uses a subset of Transition methods internally.
 * The use of this interface instead of the full imported Transition interface is [referred] to achieve
 * two things:
 * (1) the d3-transition module may not be required by a projects use case,
 * (2) it avoids possible complications from 'module augmentation' from d3-transition to Selection.

     * For %W, all days in a new year preceding the first Monday are considered to be in week 0.
     * Week numbers are computed using interval.count. For example, 2015-52 and 2016-00 represent Monday, December 28, 2015, while 2015-53 and 2016-01 represent Monday, January 4, 2016.

     * For %V,%g and %G, per the strftime man page:
     *
     * In this system, weeks start on a Monday, and are numbered from 01, for the first week, up to 52 or 53, for the last week.
     * Week 1 is the first week where four or more days fall within the new year (or, synonymously, week 01 is: the first week of the year that contains a Thursday;
     * or, the week that has 4 January in it). If the ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.
     *
     * The % sign indicating a directive may be immediately followed by a padding modifier:
     *
     * 1) 0 - zero-padding
     * 2) _ - space-padding
     * 3) - disable padding
     *
     * If no padding modifier is specified, the default is 0 for all directives except %e, which defaults to _.
     * (In some implementations of strftime and strptime, a directive may include an optional field width or precision; this feature is not yet implemented.)
