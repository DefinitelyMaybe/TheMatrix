# Welcome
This project is about doing maths in the browser. Progress is slow but lets keep going.

### Whats happening atm?
Well, theres just me working on different bits and pieces that I think are the appropriate next steps.
It changes a lot currently so I'm not detailing it much here.
Notes:
forms
graph zeros
saving and loading
mathfields/text
matrices

### Where are you going with this? Why?
Honourable mentions to Wolframalpha and Matlab. They're part of the inspiration but only half the story. The other half is my own frustations and use of very rigid but simple calculators scattered about the internet.

My notes:
A project to jump into could be the heat equation! i.e. this is how you model for heat, here are a bunch of tables with all of the values for different materials, here are some setups of the equation for specific contexts.

### How can I help?
Make something cool. Save it and then share it with others.
